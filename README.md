# Pump_Radial_Vibration_Predictor

Development of a regression model in order to predict the radial pump vibrations in a centrifugal pump. This can help in preventing the damage of radial shaft of the pump.The notebook follows a stepwise process inorder to make a relevant model without ovefitting or underfitting. Also VIF method was followed in order to keep only significant features, followed by feature engineering inorder to improve the variation expplained by the model. At the end a userdefined function was developed inorder to predict vibration value by entering values for significant features.


This notebook can be used for developing any regression model for any dataset. The dataset used for the notebook is very large and hence wasn't uploaded here. Anyhow you
can find a scaled sample of this dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jalota/sensor-readings
